# Nancy-Drew-Game-Portal
12/16/2024 - 12/24/2024
Very basic game portal I built to organize games and keep the interface user friendly.
the basic concept of the portal revolves around 2 main things, the 'nd' folder being in the root windows directory, and the folders inside to be in the correct format.
The portal gets the directories inside the 'nd' folder, so all fo the games need to be in a folder titled correctly. They also need a cover image, titled 'cover' and in jpg format.
lastly the main portal runs 'game_launcher.exe' when you click play on the game, each game thus needs a 'game_launch.exe'
the reason it uses a game launcher is because the gmaes use varrying title names, ranging from 'setup' to whatever the game title is
to solve this i created game launch files that just ran whatever the executable file was.
very simple, but its a great tool.
this is v1 and i'm going to fix design issues and the system flaws it has in the next v.
if you're wondering where to get the games you can grab nancy drew pc games from internet archive

some of the games have direct X issues, so you can also get them from steamunlocked
